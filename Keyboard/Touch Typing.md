# Touch Typing: The Essential 
As a mechanical keyboard enthusiast, a technologist and a programmer I tend to praise efficiency of a design but I might have forgotten about the efficiency of the human skill. Skills are typically more pronounced in either manual craft or art. Contrary to that technical fields are more interested in intelligent design.

A few months ago I have written [an article](https://jakubstiburek.notion.site/Better-Keys-1bf15687c9b847bb849e1aee65f2beed) about why I build my own keyboards and I haven't really talked about using them efficiently - touch typing. Building your own keyboard from scratch can be an overwhelming task for many, learning to touch type is probably more realistic improvement of your computer skills.

## Can you really type on a keyboard?
Touch typing means that a typist is able to type on a keyboard using their muscle memory rather than sight. That would be the simplest definition. With such description you may think to yourself: "Well I can do that so I can touch type." But can you really? Where are your fingers when you start typing, how do they move, do you use all of them?

### How do you type if you are not touch typing
Some people can type quite fast and effectively with just the index fingers - looking at you 60 years old doctors and you retired secretaries from B&W movies. Because the typewriter machines were sturdy and their letters were hard to press, the typists would hit the letters with quite a force. When using just two fingers the typist has to look at the keyboard because they can't rely on a constant position of hands.

There are also people who can sort of use all fingers on one hand and one or two fingers on another hand. It's cumbersome but they can mostly write without looking at the keyboard. They have probably learned to type this way on their own. I have also for many years typed this way. Unsurprisingly this "technique" is prone to making more mistakes, uneven stress on the typist's hands and overall less effective typing.

### Why touch typing is better
I've mentioned two qualities by which I judge a typing technique and they correlate with the metrics that can be applied to typing in order to measure it - it's speed and accuracy. Speed is measured in symbols or words typed in a period of type, most often we measure *words per minute*. Accuracy is measured by mistakes expressed usually as a percentage (9 correct words and 1 wrong will result in 90% accuracy). So if you want to measure your typing skills you can start a stopwatch and try to copy a paragraph of some text, then check for any mistakes. And there is of course many websites, which I will get into, that make this much easier.

[For the two-finger-typists there is a limit of about 27 WPM (words per minute) that can hardly be beaten. An average touch typist types 50 WPM and the best touch typist writes 256 WPM](https://www.typing.com/blog/typing-speed/).

If you take a test on for example [monkeytype.com](https://monkeytype.com/) and you don't touch type you'll probably score between 20 and 50 WPM. Nevertheless learning to properly touch type will inevitably increase your speed. The accuracy goes up the more you type but it can be lousy in the beginning. Don't panic it won't take too long to get better. In the end if you get good at touch typing you will type faster and more accurately.

## The decisions
When learning to touch type you will be faced with a few directions you can take. If you have a look at virtually any computer keyboard, you'll notice that the keys are distributed in a particular order. You may even know that we call this layout QERTY because those are first five letters in the top row of that layout. This layout for reasons, that I won't get into but you can learn about them in my [article about mechanical keyboards](https://jakubstiburek.notion.site/Better-Keys-1bf15687c9b847bb849e1aee65f2beed), have kinda won the lottery and is ubiquitous. But QERTY layout is definitely not the only layout nor the most effective layout it is simply the one that everyone uses. In fact there is a slightly altered QERTZ used on most keyboards in my country. On this layout the letters Y and Z are switched. I consider this change completely nonsensical so I never bothered with researching the reasons for it.

### Should you stick to the standard?
Some well known layouts are Dvorak, Workman and Colemak. Dvorak is very different from QERTY. Workman is similar to QERTY on purpose. Colemak fixes some problems of Workman and is focused on programmers.

Besides these weirdos there are other lesser known layouts and there is also another option: design your own layout. You might have specific typing needs that neither of layouts is suitable for.

Ultimately the first choice you need to make is to pick either the standard QERTY or an alternative layout. I use QERTY because I want to be able to write on any keyboard (even though I usually use my custom mechanical keyboard) without any problem.

My problem with QERTY is that I'm not writing as fast as I think I would be able. I type usually between 60 and 90 WPM which isn't great. And that's English, in my native Czech I type slower. Had I adopted an alternative layout maybe one more suitable for my native language I might be writing faster and more effective.

To me it seems as a choice between versatility and best performance. If I was a professional writer I'd go with an alternative keyboard most suitable for my language but as a programmer I sometimes have to type on different keyboards and speed isn't that important.

### Pick your tools
So you have picked the layout and now you want to learn it and practice it. Here are some web apps that I used when I learned touch typing:

- [Ngram Type](https://ranelpadon.github.io/ngram-type/) focuses on practicing bigrams, trigrams and tetragrams. These are combinations of two, three or four letters. This kind of practice will strengthen your muscle memory for common letter combinations.
- [Typing Practice - Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) is a well rounded complex educational platform. You can choose to learn any of the popular layouts and a few languages. The app takes you on a journey. First you learn the home-row keys (starting position of your fingers) and the complexity gradually increases. Keybr keeps stats and tracks your progress too.
- [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) is just a typing practice. You get a text and type it out. You can set a time or word limit and choose from a lot of exercise sources and languages. It is most suited for those who have already learned their layout and want to master it or for fun. Also it looks nice in YouTube videos.

- [typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/) is a popular game where typists can compete with each other in a typing race.
- [Epistory - Typing Chronicles](https://store.steampowered.com/app/398850) is a beautiful and unique game available on Steam. You should know your layout already before you start playing. Epistory will gamify your learning process. In the latter parts the game will be quite challenging. A great way to master touch typing for those who are already bored with the standard learning apps. And there is a sequel to the game if you really like it.

## Gamify the process & Have discipline
Learning to touch type is hard - it's not a knowledge that you could obtain from a book or a lecture, it's a skill learned through repetition. Therefore make it as pleasurable as you can and at all points of the process have a clear idea about where you are at and where you are heading to.

Quite straight forward plan that I suggest and have myself followed (though with some hiccups as I was unaware of the available tools):
1. Choose your layout
2. Pick the exercise tool
3. Start slowly (a few minutes a day) learning the home row keys
4. Eventually learn position of each key
5. Measure your speed when you feel comfortable with the layout
6. Based on your current WPM set a realistic goal and timeframe
7. Repeat 6. until you reach your limit or get bored
8. Type as fast, comfortably and effectively as you are able to

I want to stress out the gamification of the process. I have at one point almost gave up because I felt like I'm making small progress using just the online learning platforms. Everyday practice became a boring chore. Then I discovered various games like typeracer and mainly Epistory. It made the practice much more enjoyable and I was able to practice more often and for longer periods of time.

## Ultimate goal - shortcuts, keybindings and VIM
Touch typing alone will significantly increase your computer productivity but it can also be a strong foundation on which you can build and become a true hackerman.

I recommend to learn shortcuts your OS offers, keybindings of your favourite apps and if you are a programmer consider using VIM or VIM keybindings in your IDE. *The ultimate goal here is to feel repulsed when touching the mouse.* Computers, although having a graphical interface, are better suited for text input. That's why programmers still use terminal to do most of the work besides editing code (unless they use VIM and other terminal editors).

And if you do all that and still feel like there is a piece missing, consider building [your own keyboard](https://jakubstiburek.notion.site/Better-Keys-1bf15687c9b847bb849e1aee65f2beed), it's fun.
