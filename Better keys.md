As a self-taught software engineer I'm quiet used to having a different view on certain topics than my peers coming from technical backgrounds. Most often it's about our approach to organising work or communicating rather than the coding itself. One of the first things that have struck me when I started to code, even when I wasn't a professional yet, was the health issues and that a lot of IT professionals ignore them. Working as a SW developer inevitably means hours spent in front of a computer every day. So I looked at my desk and the things that I use to produce code. I saw a monitor, keyboard, computer, table and chair and I thought about the ways I can improve these to not get the carpal tunnel syndrome (or many more health problems induced by this way of life) in 10 years.

I actually started with my monitor and not the keyboard because I was using a laptop back then and I was going to get a second monitor. So my primary focus wasn't to get the highest frequency or the best colours. Don't get me wrong I wanted to get the best product I could afford but mainly I wanted a monitor that would go easy on my eyes. So I was able to purchase a monitor that can adjust contrast and brightness on the fly based on the conditions in my room. Looking back I would get a different model because I now don't use two or three monitors setup but a single big one (at the office at my work) and the one I have at home is too small for my liking. But still it's quite pleasant to look at it in the evening when the light in my room is dim. My eyes don't hurt even if I don't use a dark theme in my IDE (yes, I'm a light theme using psycho). And the monitor can be easily moved up and down to be at the right level for the person using it.

## Down the rabbit hole
Soon after I've got myself a second monitor. So I had a laptop and two monitors on my table. I decided that a standalone keyboard would be more practical than using the laptop build in even though I was pretty content with it. I went to a local PC shop and tried a few displayed keyboards. I was raised to think thoroughly before I spend money. This habit has actually turned into an obsession of sorts so I sometimes have to counter it with a spontaneous splurge. Anyway, I found out that there are basically two kinds of keyboards out there: *mechanical* and *membrane*. And so my journey to the mechanical keyboard realm has begun. Anyone who owns one must know how treacherous and deep this rabbit hole is. 

Well initially I didn't know of course... and I got myself a *gaming* mechanical keyboard. Low profile stacked with shiny LEDs that would be enough for an entire U2 show. It was kind of expensive compared to a basic 10â‚¬ membrane keyboard but still cheap for a mechanical keyboard. And it broke soon. Some keys stopped working and I was pissed. Unfortunately I couldn't return it because I tried to fix it and I messed up and broke it even more. But as I poked the thing and I googled a few things I found out that the switches (that's what goes *clickity click* when you press a key) are actually not very common even for a low profile keyboard. You see there is two or three common interfaces that connect a switch to a keycap and those I had on my first keyboard were some knockoff that wasn't compatible with anything. So had to get a new keeb. And I was just starting my research on the ***mechanical wonderland***.

## Why?
I'd like to briefly explain how these keyboards work and what kinds are there available but before that I want get to what initially made me buy a mechanical keyboard.

When typing on most membrane keyboards and predominantly on laptop keyboards the feeling of pressing a key can be mushy, sometimes keys respond to any slight touch, some keyboards bend, keys rub one another, etc. the main point is that you get what the manufacturer serves you, like it or not. And I just felt like I want a keyboard that would fit me and my hands. The mechanical keyboards are produced usually in a small quantity by invested people for their peers, you have to often put them together yourself and even if they are pre-built you still have some degree of control. You can choose the size of the keyboard, maybe you don't need a function row or a numpad... you can choose the switches, how hard are they to press, whether they make sound or not, haptic response, how precise are they and so on.

At the beginning I didn't even know what else I can customise, yet I was already sold on the idea.

## Mechanical switch
### How does a membrane keyboard work?

Mechanical switch actually predates a membrane keyboards. It was the original way how keyboards were made. 

>So a pro tip: If you want a mechanical keyboard and you are on a tight budget, just get an old keyboard from 80' or 90' from your local used electronics shop.

Nowadays keyboards are usually membrane. That means that a key is actuated by two thin metal pieces touching. This design has many advantages over the mechanical keyboards. Firstly it's much cheaper, it's thinner and it's quite durable. You can even prevent it from short circuiting when you spill a coffee on it quite easily.

This diagram shows how a membrane key actuates.

### How does a mechanical switch work?

You can see how a mechanical switch actuates when pressed on the diagram above. This particular switch is called *Cherry MX Red* and it's a very popular switch used e.g. in pro-gaming. It's so called linear switch. Meaning that the moving part is traveling from the initial position to the actuating position with no obstruction along the way. These are very precise and that's why they are popular among gamers.

The second kind of a switch is so called *tactile*, this particular is a *Cherry MX Brown*. These switches have a little bump on the moving body which upon actuation gives a haptic response to the finger. I personally like the feel of pressing a button which these tactile switches provide and I think they are the best kind for typing.

The third diagram shows a *Cherry MX Blue* which is a tactile and *clicky* switch. Unlike the linear switch this one is not silent. You can see that the moving body is made out of two parts. The white part jumps when the switch actuates resulting in a quite loud click which you either love or hate. Either way I don't recommend using these in an office. You might get hit by a mere basic Logitech keyboard in the face. 

Here is a nice video explaining the difference between a mechanical and membrane keyboard.
